-  Hi, I’m @Bballard96
-  I’m interested in starting my coding journey, getting to know the community and becoming a great programmer!
-  I've recently finished a coding bootcamp after close to a year of self teaching, and I’m currently job searching and continuing to build on my techincal knowledge.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on anything at the moment as I'm starting to take everything in.
